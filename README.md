# UMKM Waru Sidoarjo Digital Yellow Pages

## Project Overview

This project is a console-based Python application designed to manage and display business data for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (UMKM) in the Waru, Sidoarjo area. It functions as a digital "Yellow Pages," providing a structured way to store, search, update, and delete information about local businesses. The application is built with a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI), making it accessible for basic data management tasks without the need for a graphical user interface or complex database setup.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:
* **Centralized Data Management:** To provide a single, organized repository for UMKM business information in Waru, Sidoarjo.
* **Ease of Access:** To allow users to quickly search, view, and manage business details through a simple console interface.
* **Basic CRUD Operations:** To implement fundamental data operations: Create (Tambah), Read (Tampilkan), Update (Edit), and Delete (Hapus) business records.
* **User-Friendly Interaction:** To guide users with clear menus and informative messages throughout their interaction with the application.

## Problems Solved

This program addresses several common challenges faced by small businesses and local communities:

* **Information Dispersal:** In many local communities, information about UMKM businesses can be scattered across various informal channels, making it difficult for potential customers to find specific services or products. This project centralizes that information.
* **Lack of Digital Presence:** Many small UMKM might not have a strong online presence (websites, social media). This tool provides a basic digital listing for them, making their information more accessible.
* **Manual Data Management:** For administrators or community organizers, managing business data manually (e.g., in spreadsheets or physical directories) can be cumbersome and prone to errors. This program offers a structured, interactive way to perform these tasks.
* **Inefficient Search:** Finding a specific business based on criteria like category or name can be time-consuming without a searchable directory. The program provides filtering and searching capabilities.

## Benefits for Society

The "UMKM Waru Sidoarjo Digital Yellow Pages" project provides several tangible benefits for the wider community:

* **Increased UMKM Visibility:** Helps local UMKM in Waru, Sidoarjo, become more easily discoverable by potential customers. This can foster their business growth and boost the local economy.
* **Convenience for Consumers:** The community can quickly find various types of UMKM (culinary, health, automotive, etc.) around them, saving time and effort in searching for needed products or services.
* **Equitable Information Access:** Provides a basic digital platform for UMKM that may not have the resources to build their own online presence, making their business information accessible to anyone.
* **Better Decision-Making:** For both consumers and UMKM themselves, access to organized data can aid in making decisions. Consumers can compare options, while UMKM can observe category trends.
* **Potential for Community Development:** The collected data can serve as a basis for further community initiatives, such as local UMKM promotions, bazaar events, or even more targeted regional economic development.
* **Inspiration for Further Development:** This project can inspire other developers or community initiatives to build more advanced similar tools, perhaps with persistent database features or a web interface, which would further expand its benefits.

In summary, this program is not just a data management tool; it is a digital bridge connecting UMKM with the community, facilitating information access, and potentially supporting local economic growth in Waru, Sidoarjo.
